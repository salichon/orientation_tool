Readme for OBS orientation tool using ambient noise correlation

This tool read in daily 3 components (Z, H1, H2) SAC files and estimate sensor orientations using a ambient noise based method, described in Zha, Webb and Menke, 2013(GRL) (doi:10.1002/grl.50698). 

The resulting orientations follows GSN convention (Left-Handed system). See http://www.obsip.org/experiments/experiment-list/2011/cascadia/cascadia-data-restriction-and-reupload-information/


There are 3 steps.

1) Setting up the data directories and stations lists and number of days...etc. This is done by the script "setting_tool.m"
if everything is right, this file is the only one you need to edit.  You should first add the directory "lib" and its sub-directories to the Matlab path.

NOTE: the preferred data storage structure is: station/year/day/*SAC. This is the way that ccf_crossterm_general.m recognizes. A Bash shell script named seed2sac.sh is included in this package. It uses rdseed to extract data from a single SEED file and generate daily SAC files organized in the above fashion.  

2) Calculate 3C cross-correlation functions using "ccf_crossterm_general.m". For the target station A, and all other stations in the list, calculate Czz,C1z,C2z. In this step you will need the both vertical components and the H1 and H2 component for target station A. You may need to make sure the station time axis are synchronized.

3)Read in the cross-correlations and estimate the sensor orientation for ONE target station, using " calc_orientation_array_general.m" . It also does some quality control filtering to remove outliers and noisy measurements. A final mean orientation and uncertainty is given. To calculate the orientation angle of all stations, simply loop through all stations. 



Step 2) is the most time consuming part, but it only need to be run once. You may want to run step 3 many times with various parameters such as SNR criteria, frequency band and different target stations. 

The package has a sample dataset in "test_data", which contains 3 component SAC data on 6 stations, for 10 days.  

The package also has a "test_ccf" folder, which contains cross-correlation functions for select data, stacked for select days.  You don't need the test_ccf folder to calculate orientations, since it will be generated from the data if you run "ccf_crossterm_general.m".

The testlist.dat file contains the station names used in calculating cross-correlation functions. In this case both centerstationlist and stationlist are the same. But they don't have to be.

The "setting_tool.m" script in the package works with the data. You will need to change the root directory in the script to wherever you put it in.
